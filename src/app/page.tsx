              Below, you&apos;ll find the details of your task, which must be
              completed within <b>three days</b> from the time you receive it.
              While there are multiple ways to structure and build this
              application, what truly matters is your <b>approach</b> to develop
              it. <b>Design (CSS)</b> is not important; focus on the structure
              and functionality instead.

              The task description is <b>clear and well-defined</b>, accompanied

            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-justify">
              For this assignment, you will develop a small shopping application
              consisting of two pages. The first page, the <b>main page</b>,
              will display a shopping list where users can add or remove items.
              This page should include <b>lazy-loaded images with fallbacks </b>
              and a <b>search bar</b> to filter products efficiently. The second
              page, called the <b>basket (or cart) page</b>, should allow users
              to view the items they‚Äôve added, adjust the quantity of each
              product, and remove items once their count reaches zero.
              Additionally, users should be able to search within their cart,
              view the <b>total price</b> and <b>total number of products</b>,
              and see the <b>subtotal for each item</b> based on quantity and be
              able to clear the entire cart with <b>empty cart button</b>. The
              <b> basket data must persist</b> across page refreshes to ensure a
              seamless user experience in <b>both pages</b>. You will need to
              <b> design your own API structure</b>, and while creating a
              separate API service is a bonus, storing data within the project
              is also acceptable. A <b>fully responsive design</b> is required
              to ensure the app works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
              devices.
              <b> TypeScript is mandatory</b>, and you are free to use any
              frontend framework of your choice (Nuxt, Next, React, Vue, etc.)
              or even vanilla along with your preferred UI library. Your project
              should be
              <b> well-structured and well-documented</b>, include a clear
              <b> README</b>, and be hosted on a <b>public GitHub repository</b>
              . Additionally, the application must be <b>Dockerized</b>, with
              setup instructions provided. Below is a rough wireframe of the
              expected layout and functionality, but you are encouraged to come
              up with your own design approach while maintaining the required
              functionality and usability.
